### Make it spicy ðŸŒ¶

    - [Seek Style Guide](http://seek-oss.github.io/seek-style-guide/)
    - [seek-style-guide GitHub page](https://github.com/seek-oss/seek-style-guide)
- Product listings populate from a JSON of products

## Future improvements
- Special pricing rules
    - What if the 'BOGO' type rule can be applied across products, e.g.: 'Buy 2 Classic Ads, get 1 Stand Out Ad free'?
- Reassess cart totals including discounts before updating state
